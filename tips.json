By default, the NVDA key is set to the two insert keys. The key that is long and skinny on the number pad is the insert key. Also, the extended insert key is probably towards the top row of keys. To set your NVDA keys, open the keyboard settings dialog with the NVDA key and the letter n, and then find keyboard settings in the general settings menu."
